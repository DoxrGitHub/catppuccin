# catppuccin
just a css storage thingy of something i made

```
  <link href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/DoxrGitHub/catppuccin/1eb018d43aca00d43e0040025d625229821b86a7/bg.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```


it generates a cool background, completely inspired from catpuccin catwalk.

> beware: the css is haunted. this is not a joke.
